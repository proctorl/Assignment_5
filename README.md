# Assignment_5
Added 3 scenes:
# Intro Scene
 Intro scene consists of the instruction on how to play, sliders for controlling the speed of the ball and the target, an input field for   entering your name, a dropdown selector for choosing rounds and a button to start playing.
# Main Scene
 The main scene is where the game is played. Contains the ball and the targets.
# Exit Scene
 The exit scene has similar functionality as the intro scene, except the canvas has been removed. You can exit or play again from here.
# ADDED A SPOOKY THEME TO THE PROJECT
